<h4>Transforming Challenges into Solutions, One Feature at a Time.</h4>

As a former instructor at <b>Iran Language Institute</b>, I experienced firsthand the frustrations of the online teaching platform—tedious workflows, inefficient tools, and a lack of user-centric design. My colleagues often shared their struggles, especially with the assignment feedback system, and I realized how these pain points drove users away from the platform to alternatives like WhatsApp.

Armed with this knowledge and a passion for design, I embarked on a mission to improve the **user experience** (UX) and **user retention** of the assignment section. This case study details my journey, using **design thinking**, to identify issues, ideate solutions, and create a more efficient feedback process.

### Business Objective

Given that the platform is developed by a government organization with a focus on local systems, the primary goals were:

1. Improving user retention by addressing core pain points.
2. Enhancing the user experience to support instructors and students alike.

### Phase 1: Empathize

### Uncovering the Pain Points

The first step was to understand the users: instructors and students. Discussions in teacher forums revealed key challenges:

- Inefficient tools for providing feedback.
- Repetitive and time-consuming grading workflows.
- Frustration with the system's rigidity, pushing users to external platforms.

To dig deeper, I conducted interviews with three instructors and developed a 24-question survey to quantify dissatisfaction levels and pinpoint specific issues.

### Key Insights

- Assignments were time-intensive and lacked efficient feedback tools.
- Instructors felt unsupported by the system's design.
- Mobile responsiveness was poor, limiting flexibility for instructors working on-the-go.

### Phase 2: Define

### The Problem Statement

The assignment section of the platform is seen as burdensome and outdated, causing a drop in user retention and forcing users to adopt external tools. This impacts the platform's usability and effectiveness.

### Phase 3: Ideate

Before ideating solutions, I conducted a **competitive analysis**, exploring similar platforms to identify innovative features. Inspired by best practices in EdTech, I created an **effort-impact matrix** to prioritize ideas.

### Key Features Proposed

1. **Voice Feedback**: For nuanced, quick responses to student work.
2. **Emoji Feedback**: To add warmth and simplicity to responses.
3. **Sorting & Filtering**: To streamline task management for instructors.
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhanced design for tablet and phone users.

### Phase 4: Prototype

I designed wireframes and interactive prototypes to test these features with real users.

### Phase 5: Test

### Usability Testing

Testing was conducted with five language instructors, aligning with best practices to uncover approximately 80% of usability issues.

### Test Tasks

- Assigning new homework.
- Grading assignments.
- Providing feedback using new tools (voice and emoji).

### Results

- **Voice Feedback**: Reduced feedback time by 75%, enabling instructors to complete tasks in 15 minutes instead of an hour.
- **Sorting/Filtering**: Highly appreciated for simplifying task navigation.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Made the platform intuitive across devices.

### Reflection

### What Worked

Instructors across different technical skill levels found the updates intuitive and time-saving. Feedback tools like voice feedback and emoji responses significantly reduced task completion times and added a layer of personalization.

### What Needs Improvement

During testing, participants noted the absence of annotation tools for assignments. This feature has been added to the roadmap for future updates.

### Final Outcome

The redesign resulted in a seamless and efficient feedback process, improved user satisfaction, and helped increase user retention. Instructors now feel empowered, not burdened, by the platform.

### A Human-Centered Design Approach

By deeply empathizing with instructors' needs, this redesign transformed the assignment section into a space that saves time, reduces frustration, and supports teaching workflows. This project reinforced my belief in the power of design thinking to create meaningful solutions tailored to real-world problems.

### Next Steps

Adding annotation tools and conducting further tests to ensure continuous improvement.
