In this project, I led the product design of a Telegram Mini-App that turns AI training into a **gamified experience**. Users engage in simple tasks, earn rewards, and interact with an **AI agent** — all within a seamless, playful interface. My primary focus was crafting an **intuitive user journey**, balancing simplicity with motivation using **gamification strategies**.

### The Challenge

We needed to build a lightweight, engaging experience that:

- Works natively inside Telegram.
- Encourages users to connect their wallet, complete onboarding tasks, and train an AI agent.
- Provides a sense of progress and reward, without overwhelming the user.
- Feels fun, but remains functional and goal-oriented.

### My Role

As the Product Designer, I was responsible for:

- Designing the entire user interface and experience.
- Creating a dynamic How-To screen that adapts to user progress.
- Integrating gamification principles to increase user motivation.
- Collaborating with developers to ensure a seamless Telegram-native implementation.
- Writing clear, action-driven UX copy that simplifies complex actions like wallet connection and task completion.

### Gamification Design

To keep users engaged and returning:

- Incorporated a spinning wheel and <b>“Golden Time”</b> bonus window to add suspense and reward timing.
- Designed task-based incentives: users earn tokens by joining channels or inviting friends, creating social loops.

### Character Design & Animation

I designed two original characters to anchor the narrative:

#### The Astronaut
A confident, adventurous figure symbolizing the user's journey through the AI galaxy. Designed in a clean vector style with bold outlines and vibrant accents.

#### The AI Agent
A whimsical, evolving entity that reacts to user progress. On initial load, it animates gently. As users interact and "train" it, the AI becomes more expressive, unlocking new visual states and reactions.

### Reflections
This project challenged me to go beyond traditional UI thinking and design for emotion and curiosity. By using **animated characters**, **adaptive UI**, and **gamified systems**, I created a world that feels alive — one where users don’t just complete tasks, but explore, wonder, and play.

It was a reminder that **personality in product design** — even in simple flows — can be the key to creating meaningful and memorable user experiences.
